# Vigenere Cipher 
To use the tool for decrypting Vigenere cipher go to the Project 1 branch and download all files. Next open a directory or as a project in an ide. Open the Python file named script.py and add your cipher text in the ciphertext variable in line 14 using Pyperclip or just typing out the text, the program will run through the analysis and give a key. <br>
Note that the codebreakers case takes a bit of time (15-20 min) to identify because it is 12 letters and the word not being very common. Even after going through frequency analysis and Kasiski examination, brute force through all keys takes a bit of time. Also for most of this, I read and understood the code (did a bit of modifying) from https://inventwithpython.com/cracking/chapter20.html
# RSA Digital Signatures
To use the tool go to Project 2 branch and download all files following the same steps as above. Add a text file to your directory for which you want to obtain a digital signature for and then use sign.py to sign it by typing the file name. To verify run the verifier.py in the branch.
